### Meet Donovan  
Hi there, I am a Computer Support IT Technician turned Self-taught Developer, occasional Mentor and Technology Instructor located in Michigan. Other than that, I am a huge Geek/Nerd when it comes to gaming both new and classic games especially most things Nintendo (I'm really good at Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros.) I also enjoy comics books, and pop culture in general.

Proud to say that I  currently work at my dream company [Detroit Labs](https://www.detroitlabs.com) as an Onsite Developer working on various exciting software development projects for [Quicken Loans](https://www.quickenloans.com).
