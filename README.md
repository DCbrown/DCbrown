# Meet Donovan  
Hi there, I am a Computer Support IT Technician turned Self-taught Developer, occasional Mentor and Technology Instructor located in Michigan. Other than that, I am a huge Geek/Nerd when it comes to gaming both new and classic games especially most things Nintendo (I'm really good at Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros.) I also enjoy comics books, and pop culture in general.

Proud to say that I currently work at my dream company [Detroit Labs](https://www.detroitlabs.com) as a JavaScript Developer and often volunteer at a community based software developer meetup group called [Co-Labs](https://www.detroitlabs.com/colabs/).
